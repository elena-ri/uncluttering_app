    "START": "<h3>Welcome!</h3>This little app here will help you unclutter your home! We'll guide you through a set of questions to support you in figuring out what to do about all the stuff that's creating messes around your home.<br><br>If this is your first time here or you have some questions, you can review the instructions before you begin.<br><br>Or just pick up an item that's bothering you and head over to the first question.",
    "FIRST_QUESTION": "Does this item <b>belong to you</b> or to <b>someone else</b>?",
    "INSTRUCTIONS": "<h3>Okay, so here's the general idea.</h3>This app is designed to helo you unclutter your home. You will find out which of your belongings you'll want keep (but maybe store in a different space) or what you'll want to let go of. We won't pressure you to prematurely get rid of stuff if you don't feel great about it. You get to decide! BUT: You get to come to a decision in a structured way, and my biggest hope is that you'll truly feel great about finally making a choice. The clarity and relief it can bring is just profound.<h3>Preparations</h3>If you just want to try out the app, don't worry about this, just begin by picking up one item and answer the first questions about it.<br><br>But if you notice you like this app, here's an idea for how to set up your decluttering process.<h4>Sorting boxes</h4>Imagine a random shelf or drawer at your home. If you're like me, there's an assortment of different items: Here's your favorite pullover with a hole that needs to be mended. There's some empty batteries you want to bring to recycling. There's a bunch of greeting cards that you're not sure you'll ever use (but they were a gift from grandma). And so on.<br><br>If you take a bird's eye view you can assign any item you possess to one of these three categories:<ul><li>Stuff you want to keep</li><li>Stuff you want to get rid of</li><li>Stuff where you don't know yet if you want to keep or get rid of it</li></ul>There are sub-categories, of course. So let's look at the three items on your shelf:<ul><li>The pullover is <i>an item you want to keep but that needs to be fixed</i>.</li><li>The empty batteries are <i>items you want to get rid of and they need to be brought to recycling</i>.</li><li>The greeting cards are <i>an item that you're conflicted about</i>.</li></ul>So, the basic idea is to set up spaces for each category that you can easily sort these items into. A \"space\" can be a box, a bag, a shelf or a drawer for example.<br><br>Below is the list of categories that I set up spaces for. For some, I have these spaces permanently and will put items into them when I notice they should be in there. For example, I have a drawer for clothes that need to be mended. For others I just create a space when I begin de-cluttering.<ul>Stuff that I want to keep:<li><b>To Do:</b> There's something I need to do about this item, for example fixing or cleaning it</li><li><b>Memories:</b> I want to keep it because it means something to me, but I don't want to see it every day</li></ul><li>Stuff that I don't want to keep:</li><ul><li><b>Donate or gift:</b> Things that I don't use but other people could still use</li><li><b>Trash or recycle:</b> Stuff that I don't want to keep and nobody else could/should use</li></ul><li>Stuff that I'm unsure about</li><ul><li><b>Inbox:</b> All the stuff that I have floating around that I need to run through this questionnaire</li><li><b>Test:</b> Some things that I need to try out before I can make a decision</li><li><b>Trial period:</b> All the things that I'm not sure I want to keep but have a hard time letting go of. I put them in there, then review this box periodically.</li></ul></ul>So that my set-up and the way this app is structured, but feel absolutely free to adapt this to your own needs.<h4>To Do Lists</h4>Very likely you'll run into a lot of tasks when uncluttering your home. The empty bottles need to be brought to recycling. The filthy water kettle needs to be cleaned. You need to research if you can fix the broken handle of your favorite cup.<br><br>My best practice is to not do each task whenever I run into it, but to note down the task on a to do list, place the item in a box/place in the meantime. Then go through the tasks in batches. For example: Collect all the items you want to bring to a charity shop in a box, then bring all of them away at once. Or make a list of all the emails you need to send and then write them all in one session.<br><br>You can do the to do list on a piece of paper or a digital application for managing to dos. Whatever you prefer.",
